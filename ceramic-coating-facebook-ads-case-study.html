                <h2 class="section-heading">The Breakdown</h2>
                <div class="bio-text">
                    <p>What's going on, guys? In this case study, I want to walk you through a really quick ceramic
                        coating success story. One ad, 30 days. We got 79 ceramic coating leads. I'm going to show you
                        the exact setup that we ran for that.</p>

                    <p>This campaign actually was just from my end a very low touch point. Just kind of a test for the
                        client. I think they had more of an issue on the sales side. And in all fairness, ceramic
                        coating is a hard sell unless you're on top of things. But 79 leads coming in looking at the
                        last 30 days and I think even just for this month the results were even better. Right? Just this
                        month 70 leads coming in in 23 days in December. So not a peak ceramic coating time of year.</p>

                    <p><strong>$7.44 cost per lead</strong>, right? With a amount spent of $520. 70 leads, guys. That's
                        insane, right? Looking at the campaign or the adsets rather—just one adset. We did run detailing
                        for a bit but didn't run it long enough to really see it through. But ceramic coating again
                        <strong>$5.66</strong>. That's the real play here, right? That is amazing. $5 leads coming in
                        for ceramic coating. 60 leads, right? That's more than two leads basically every single day
                        coming through December.
                    </p>

                    <p>Clicking into the campaign, we had two ads. Facebook just really took off with this single video
                        ad. It's just a walkaround of the car saying, you know, we're doing ceramic coating in your area
                        with the text. And really straightforward. If we look at the ad itself, you can see that we have
                        the form, but looking at the actual ad copy, right? Hey Palm Bay, you've got prices here. You've
                        got calls to action, right? You can see the copy here. You got pain points.</p>

                    <p>Ceramic coding quote as a headline. Get your free quote. Call to action is "Get Quote." And that
                        goes just right to a Facebook Instant Form. And if you get back to these guys really quickly
                        within one or two minutes if you can, then you just get tons of leads coming in.</p>

                    <p>Normally, you would see even better results. And you can also run this to a landing page, to a
                        direct booking funnel. I know ceramic coating people do want quotes. So it is a little bit
                        tougher on the sales side of things, but even if you close one in 10 of these, that's still
                        really amazing results and is going to keep you busy. And that's like a worst case scenario
                        there, right?</p>
