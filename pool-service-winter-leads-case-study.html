                    <h2>The Setup: Is Winter Dead for Pool Service?</h2>
                    <p>If you own a pool business in Florida, you know the drill. November through February is supposed
                        to be the "slow season." The water is cold, people aren't swimming, and marketing usually goes
                        quiet.</p>
                    <p>But we just ran a test that proves the opposite.</p>
                    <p>In this case study, I’m breaking down a campaign we ran for a client in Port St. Lucie, Florida,
                        over the last 30 days (Dec–Jan). The goal? prove that you can build route density even when the
                        weather isn't cooperating.</p>

                    <h2>The Numbers (At a Glance)</h2>
                    <p>We ran a dedicated Facebook Ads campaign targeting homeowners. Here is exactly what happened in
                        the last 30 days:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Total Ad Spend:</strong> ~$1,000</li>
                        <li><strong>Total Leads Generated:</strong> 48</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost Per Lead (CPL):</strong> $21.00</li>
                        <li><strong>Estimated New Pools Added:</strong> ~10–15</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Facebook vs. Google: The Cost Difference</h2>
                    <p>Why did we choose Facebook for this? It comes down to cost. On Google Ads, keywords like "pool
                        cleaning near me" are incredibly competitive. I typically see a Cost Per Lead (CPL) of $100+ on
                        Google for similar campaigns.</p>
                    <p>On Facebook, we achieved a $21 CPL. That is roughly 1/5th the cost.</p>
                    <p>Now, I want to be transparent about lead quality. Google leads are "bottom of funnel"—they are
                        searching for you, so they are ready to buy. Facebook leads are "interruption marketing."
                        Roughly one-third of the leads we generated didn't actually have a pool or weren't qualified.
                    </p>
                    <p>But let's look at the math: Even if we throw out 33% of the leads as "bad," we are left with
                        roughly 35 qualified homeowners for $1,000. That is a "Qualified CPL" of roughly $60.</p>
                    <p>In the pool industry, a customer isn't a one-time transaction. They pay you monthly for years.
                        Paying $60 (or even $150 to close the deal) to acquire a customer who pays you thousands over
                        their lifetime is a no-brainer.</p>

                    <h2>The Strategy: Image vs. Video</h2>
                    <p>We didn't just throw money at the wall. We tested 30 to 40 different creatives to find the
                        winner. Interestingly, in this specific campaign, Static Images outperformed Video.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Video Ad:</strong> Performed well, but slightly higher costs.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Image Ad:</strong> Outpaced the video by about 10% in terms of cost efficiency.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Marketing Tip:</strong> You don't always need high-production video. Sometimes a clear,
                        high-quality image of a clean pool with a strong offer is all you need to stop the scroll.</p>

                        are just trying to maintain, this client added roughly 10 to 15 new pools to their route.</p>
                    <p>We are currently doubling the ad spend for January, and looking to double again in Spring to hit
                        a $3,000/month budget. The goal is simple: reliable leads coming in every single day.</p>
