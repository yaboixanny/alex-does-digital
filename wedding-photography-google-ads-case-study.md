# Wedding Photography Google Ads Case Study: 96 Leads in 30 Days

How a London-based wedding photographer generated consistent leads with a simple, low-budget Google Ads strategy.

## The Results

Over a 30-day period (November 1–30), this campaign delivered:

- **96 form submissions** (verified via Google Analytics 4)
- **15% overall conversion rate**
- **8–12x return on ad spend** depending on the month

For every £1,000 spent on ads, the client saw £8,000–£12,000 in revenue.

## Campaign Breakdown

### Performance Max (PMax)

The bulk of results came from a Performance Max campaign running at just **£6/day**. This single campaign generated **61 conversions**.

A note on PMax: not every lead is qualified. Some are tire-kickers, some don't answer the phone, and some find the service too expensive. But even converting just 10% of these leads means 6 booked weddings per month—more than enough for a solo photographer.

### Search Campaigns

Additional search ad groups targeted specific neighborhoods and keywords:

| Ad Group | Conversion Rate |
|----------|-----------------|
| Hackney Wedding Photographer | 23% |
| London Wedding Photographer | 17% |
| Marylebone Wedding Photographer | 12% |

Cost per lead was higher in niche areas like Marylebone, but with fewer competitors offering wedding photography there, even one booking per month makes the spend worthwhile.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Simple Beats Complex

This wasn't a complicated setup. One ad group per location, a PMax campaign, and a modest daily budget. No rocket science required.

### 2. Landing Pages Matter

The client used their existing website rather than a dedicated landing page—a common choice among wedding photographers. The site wasn't optimized for conversions, yet the campaign still performed well.

The opportunity here is significant: **double the conversion rate with a better landing page, and you cut cost per lead in half.**

### 3. Room to Scale

Search impression share was under 10% for some ad groups, meaning there's massive headroom to increase budget and capture more of the market.

## US vs. UK Markets

For photographers in the US, the economics are even more favorable:

- Cost per click is similar (or lower)
- Wedding photography prices are higher
- Competition levels are comparable to London

This translates to potentially higher returns on the same ad spend.

## The Bottom Line

Google Ads works for wedding photographers. With a focused strategy, modest budget, and proper tracking, you can generate a steady stream of qualified leads. And if you invest in a conversion-optimized landing page, those results only get better.
